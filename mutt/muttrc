#  3.8. Ignoring (weeding) unwanted message headers
#
#  Usage: [un]ignore pattern [ pattern ... ]
#
#  Messages often have many header fields added by automatic processing
#  systems, or which may not seem useful to display on the screen.  This
#  command allows you to specify header fields which you don't normally
#  want to see.
#
#  You do not need to specify the full header field name.  For example,
#  ``ignore content-'' will ignore all header fields that begin with the
#  pattern ``content-''.
#
#  To remove a previously added token from the list, use the ``unignore''
#  command.  Note that if you do ``ignore x-'' it is not possible to
#  ``unignore x-mailer,'' for example.  The ``unignore'' command does not
#  make Mutt display headers with the given pattern.
#
#  ``unignore *'' will remove all tokens from the ignore list.
#
# If you want to see all headers again type "h".
